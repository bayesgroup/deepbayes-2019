In the assignment, we will consider a real-valued non-volume preserving normalizing flows (Real NVP) -- a special case of normalizing flow.\n","\n","#### Problem setting\n","\n","Our goal is to train a generative network $g_\\theta:  Z \\rightarrow X, g = f^{-1}$ that maps latent variable $z \\sim p(z)$ to a sample $x \\sim p(x)$. Where $p(z)$ is a prior distibiution and $p(x)$ is a data distibution. An illustrative example is provided below.\n","\n","![alt text](https://senya-ashukha.github.io/assignments/normalizing-flows/2d-example.png)\n","\n","#### Change of variable formula\n","\n","Given an observed data variable $x \\in X$,\n","a simple prior probability distribution $p_{Z}$ on a latent variable $z \\in Z$,\n","and a bijection $f: X \\rightarrow Z$ (with $g = f^{-1}$),\n","the change of variable formula defines a model distribution of $X$ by\n","<!-- \\begin{align}\n","p_{X}(x) &= p_{Z}\\big(f(x)\\big) \\left|\\det\\left(\\cfrac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x^T} \\right)\\right|\n","\\label{eq:change-variables}\\\\\n","\\log\\left(p_{X}(x)\\right) &= \\log\\Big(p_{Z}\\big(f(x)\\big)\\Big) + \\log\\left(\\left|\\det\\left(\\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x^T}\\right)\\right|\\right)\n",",\n","\\end{align} -->\n","\n","![alt text](https://senya-ashukha.github.io/assignments/normalizing-flows/f.png)\n","where $\\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x^T}$ is the Jacobian of $f$ at $x$.\n","\n","Exact samples from the resulting distribution can be generated by using the inverse transform sampling rule. A sample $z \\sim p_{Z}$ is drawn in the latent space, and its inverse image $x = f^{-1}(z) = g(z)$ generates a sample in the original space. Computing the density at a point $x$ is accomplished by computing the density of its image $f(x)$ and multiplying by the associated Jacobian determinant $\\det\\left(\\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x^T}\\right)$.\n","\n","#### Real NVP\n","\n","Real NVP presents a class of functions where $\\log\\left(\\left|\\det\\left(\\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x^T}\\right)\\right|\\right)$ can be computed efficiently (see, 3.3 Properties, https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08803). Every layer of Real NVP is a coupling layer followed by permutation layer. Combination of coupling and permutation layers can be implemented as a masked version of the coupling layer:\n","## $$y = b \\odot x + (1 - b) \\odot \\Big(x \\odot \\exp\\big(s(b \\odot x)\\big) + t(b \\odot x)\\Big)$$\n","\n","where $s$ and $t$ stand for scale and translation, and are functions from $R^{D} \\mapsto R^{D}$, and $\\odot$ is the Hadamard product or element-wise product, $b$ is a binary mask.
