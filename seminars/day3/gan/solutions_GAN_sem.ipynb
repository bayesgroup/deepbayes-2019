For the first part almost everything is written for you, and you only need to implement the objective for the game and play around with the model. \n","\n","**0)** Read the code\n","\n","**1)** Implement objective for a vanilla [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf) (GAN). The hyperparameters are already set in the code. The model will converge if you implement the objective (1) right. \n","\n","**2)** Note the discussion in the paper, that the objective for $G$ can be of two kinds: $\\min_G \\log(1 - D)$ and $\\min_G - \\log(D)$. Now implement the second objective and ensure model converges. Most likely, in this example you will not notice the difference, but people usually use the second objective, it really matters in more complicated scenarios. **NOTE:** the objective for D stays the same.\n","\n","**3 & 4)** Implement [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf) and WGAN-GP. To make the discriminator has Lipschitz property you need to clip discriminator's weights to $[-0.01, 0.01]$ range (WGAN) or use gradient penalty (WGAN-GP). You will need to make few modifications to the code: \n","\n","   - Remove sigmoids from discriminator;\n","   - Change objective (see eq. 3 and algorithm 1 in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf)): \n","   - Add weight clipping for D [see here](https://github.com/martinarjovsky/WassersteinGAN/blob/master/main.py#L172) / gradient penaly (WGAN-GP) [code](https://gist.github.com/DmitryUlyanov/19ce84045135e3f81a477629e685aec8); \n","\n","   \n","In general see [implementation 1](https://github.com/martinarjovsky/WassersteinGAN/blob/master/main.py#L172) / [implementation 2](https://github.com/caogang/wgan-gp). They also use different optimizer. \n","\n","The default hyperparameters may not work well, spend some time to tune them -- play with learning rate, number of D updates per one G update, change architecture (what about weight initialization?). \n","\n","**5) Bonus: Wasserstein Introspective Neural Networkss**. This is basically WGAN-GP without generator. Read and implement [WINN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08875.pdf) for our toy task. The classification step is almost identical to the discriminative step for WGAN-GP. However on synthesis step, we will not use a generator network, but instead we optimize the same loss as the generator loss in WGAN-GP with respect to the *generated objects* (aka \"pseudo-negative samples\"). Then, we accumulate the generated \"pseudo-negative\" samples and use mini-batches from them as the \"fake data\" for the next classification step.\n","\n","Here are some tips for you:\n","- Initialize your \"fake dataset\" with random noise.\n","- During the classification stage, sample fake data from the fake dataset.\n","- For the synthesis step, use the fake samples from the previous step as the initial value.\n","- You can use an ordinary Adam optimizer to update the samples, but you need to inject small noise on each step (last equation on page 4). Do not forget to early stop after the threshold (page 5, first paragraph) is reached.\n","- Add the new generated points to the \"fake dataset\".\n","\n","To make the visualization work without a generator, you have to supply your generated samples to `vis_points` function."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ubl78LmBrFUx","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["\"\"\" \n","    Please, implement everything in one notebook, using if statements to switch between the tasks\n","\"\"\"\n","# TASK in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","TASK = 1"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nJPseo0grFU2","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Imports"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"k17KjAivrP9F","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!pip3 install https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch-1.0.1.post2-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl\n","!pip3 install torchvision"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"dE21X55trFU3","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import time\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.optim as optim\n","import torch\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","%matplotlib inline\n","\n","torch.set_num_threads(4)\n","np.random.seed(12345)\n","lims=(-5, 5)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"u1paAVQvrFU6","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Define sampler from real data and Z "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"E2MQTdQ4rFU-","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Some utility functions."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"VanMNBMmrFVB","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["from scipy.stats import rv_discrete\n","\n","MEANS = np.array(\n","        [[-1,-3],\n","         [1,3],\n","         [-2,0],\n","        ])\n","COVS = np.array(\n","        [[[1,0.8],[0.8,1]],\n","        [[1,-0.5],[-0.5,1]],\n","        [[1,0],[0,1]],\n","        ])\n","PROBS = np.array([\n","        0.2,\n","        0.5,\n","        0.3\n","        ])\n","assert len(MEANS) == len(COVS) == len(PROBS), \"number of components mismatch\"\n","COMPONENTS = len(MEANS)\n","\n","comps_dist = rv_discrete(values=(range(COMPONENTS), PROBS))\n","\n","def sample_true(N):\n","    comps = comps_dist.rvs(size=N)\n","    conds = np.arange(COMPONENTS)[:,None] == comps[None,:]\n","    arr = np.array([np.random.multivariate_normal(MEANS[c], COVS[c], size=N)\n","                     for c in range(COMPONENTS)])\n","    return np.select(conds[:,:,None], arr).astype(np.float32)\n","\n","NOISE_DIM = 20\n","def sample_noise(N):\n","    return np.random.normal(size=(N,NOISE_DIM)).astype(np.float32)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dngENj5orFVF","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Visualization functions"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qgvLtQqZrFVG","colab_type":"text"},"source":["And more utility functions."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-lx2DhoarFVH","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["def vis_data(data):\n","    \"\"\"\n","        Visualizes data as histogram\n","    \"\"\"\n","    hist = np.histogram2d(data[:, 1], data[:, 0], bins=100, range=[lims, lims])\n","    plt.pcolormesh(hist[1], hist[2], hist[0], alpha=0.5)\n","\n","fixed_noise = torch.Tensor(sample_noise(1000))\n","def vis_g():\n","    \"\"\"\n","        Visualizes generator's samples as circles\n","    \"\"\"\n","    data = generator(fixed_noise).data.numpy()\n","    if np.isnan(data).any():\n","        return\n","    \n","    plt.scatter(data[:,0], data[:,1], alpha=0.2, c='b')\n","    plt.xlim(lims)\n","    plt.ylim(lims)\n","    \n","    \n","def vis_points(data):\n","    \"\"\"\n","        Visualizes the supplied samples as circles\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if np.isnan(data).any():\n","        return\n","    \n","    plt.scatter(data[:,0], data[:,1], alpha=0.2, c='b')\n","    plt.xlim(lims)\n","    plt.ylim(lims)\n","    \n","\n","def get_grid():\n","    X, Y = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(lims[0], lims[1], 30), np.linspace(lims[0], lims[1], 30))\n","    X = X.flatten()\n","    Y = Y.flatten()\n","        \n","    grid = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([X, Y]).astype(np.float32).T)\n","    grid.requires_grad = True\n","                            \n","    return X, Y, grid\n","              \n","X_grid, Y_grid, grid = get_grid()\n","def vis_d():\n","    \"\"\"\n","        Visualizes discriminator's gradient on grid\n","    \"\"\"\n","        \n","    data_gen = generator(fixed_noise)\n","#     loss = d_loss(discriminator(data_gen), discriminator(grid))\n","    loss = g_loss(discriminator(grid))\n","    loss.backward()\n","    \n","    grads = -
